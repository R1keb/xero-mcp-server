## Usage

Once the server is running, you can make API calls to interact with Xero. Below are some examples of how to use the server effectively.

### Authentication

Authenticate your application with Xero by directing users to the authorization URL. After authorization, Xero will redirect to your specified redirect URI with an authorization code.

### Making API Calls

You can use the server's endpoints to access Xero data. Here‚Äôs a simple example:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/invoices
```

This will return a list of invoices from your Xero account.

### Automating Tasks

You can set up scheduled tasks using cron jobs to automate routine financial processes. For example, you can create a cron job to fetch invoices every hour.
